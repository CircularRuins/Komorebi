### Twitter does not provide RSS service officially

### The Twitter RSS service used in this app is provided by BestBlogs, currently free (thanks 🙏)

### Users can visit the <mark>[BestBlogs repository](https://github.com/ginobefun/BestBlogs)</mark> to find more Twitter RSS feeds

### Find the user you want to subscribe to and copy their RSS link

### Paste the link into the RSS URL input box at the top of the page, click the Add button to subscribe

### If you can't find the user you want to subscribe to in BestBlogs, you can try suggesting to the BestBlogs project maintainers to add new feeds
### Or use paid RSS services like <mark>[RSS.app](https://rss.app/)</mark>
