### Some Newsletters have built-in RSS service, such as BestBlogs

### For most Newsletters without RSS functionality, you can use Kill the Newsletter to subscribe to them, currently free (thanks 🙏)

### Users can visit the <mark>[Kill the Newsletter website](https://kill-the-newsletter.com/)</mark>

### Give your feed a name, then click Create Feed

### The website will then generate a virtual email address and an Atom feed for you

### Go to the Newsletter website you want to subscribe to (using AI Valley as an example here) and subscribe using the virtual email address provided by Kill the Newsletter

### Finally, paste the Atom feed provided by Kill the Newsletter into the RSS URL input box at the top of the page, click the Add button to subscribe

### After subscribing to a newsletter, there will be no content initially, which is normal. You need to wait until you receive the first newsletter before content appears
