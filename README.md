</p>

Komorebi (木漏れ日) is a Japanese word describing the dappled sunlight filtering through leaves and trees. Currently, AI is the hottest field—like the sun itself—and the vast amount of related information shines and burns like direct sunlight, overwhelming people with information anxiety. Komorebi aims to thoughtfully curate information sources and refine product features to deliver the best possible user experience, making the process of consuming information as enjoyable as bathing in komorebi—the gentle, dappled sunlight filtering through trees.
