## ☀️ Product Philosophy
**Komorebi (木漏れ日)** is a Japanese word that describes the soft, dappled sunlight filtering through leaves and trees.

Today, AI is the hottest field—like the sun itself. An overwhelming flood of news, products, and research shines down relentlessly, often leaving people burned out and anxious rather than informed.

Komorebi is designed to be a filter, not another beam of direct light. By carefully curating information sources and refining product features, it transforms the experience of staying informed into something calm, focused, and enjoyable—like standing beneath the trees, absorbing only the gentle warmth of komorebi.
